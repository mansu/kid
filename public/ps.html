If all column headers are empty (ps -o pid= -o comm=) then the header line will not be output. Column width will increase as needed for wide headers; this may be used to widen up columns such as WCHAN (ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm). Explicit width control (ps opid,wchan:42,cmd) is offered too. The behavior of ps -o pid=X,comm=Y varies with personality; output may be one column named "X,comm=Y" or two columns named "X" and "Y". Use multiple -o options when in doubt.

<dd>Show process hierarchy (forest)</dd>

<dt>N namelist</dt>
<dd>Specify namelist file. Identical to -n, see -n above</dd>

<dt>O order</dt>
<dd>Sorting order. (overloaded) The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with some common fields predefined) or can be used to specify sort order. Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option. To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g. with -O or --sort)<br />
For sorting, obsolete BSD O option syntax is O[+|-]k1[,[+|-]k2[,...]]. It orders the processes listing according to the multilevel sort specified by the sequence of one-letter short keys k1, k2, ... described in the OBSOLETE SORT KEYS section below. The "+" is currently optional, merely re-iterating the default direction on a key, but may help to distinguish an O sort from an O format. The "-" reverses direction only on the key it precedes.</dd>

<dt>S</dt>
<dd>Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child processes into their parent. This is useful for examining a system where a parent process repeatedly forks off short-lived children to do work</dd>

<dt>c</dt>
<dd>Show the true command name. This is derived from the name of the executable file, rather than from the argv value.  Command arguments and any modifications to them (see setproctitle(3)) are thus not shown. This option effectively turns the args format keyword into the comm format keyword; it is useful with the -f format option and with the various BSD-style format options, which all normally display the command arguments. See the -f option, the format keyword args, and the format keyword comm.</dd>

<dt>e</dt>
<dd>Show the environment after the command.</dd>

<dt>f</dt>
<dd>ASCII-art process hierarchy (forest)</dd>

<dt>h</dt>
<dd>No header. (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality). The h option is problematic. Standard BSD ps uses this option to print a header on each page of output, but older Linux ps uses this option to totally disable the header. This version of ps follows the Linux usage of not printing the header unless the BSD personality has been selected, in which case it prints a header on each page of output. Regardless of the current personality, you can use the long options --headers and --no-headers to enable printing headers each page or disable headers entirely, respectively.</dd>

<dt>k spec</dt>
<dd>specify sorting order. Sorting syntax is [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]] Choose a multi-letter key from the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section. The "+" is optional since default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order. Identical to --sort. Examples:<br />
                   * ps jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid<br />
                   * ps axk comm o comm,args<br />
                   * ps kstart_time -ef</dd>

<dt>-n namelist</dt>
<dd>set namelist file. Identical to N.  The namelist file is needed for a proper WCHAN display, and must match the current Linux kernel exactly for correct output. Without this option, the default search path for the namelist is:<br />
                        * $PS_SYSMAP<br />
                        * $PS_SYSTEM_MAP<br />

<div id=node1 data-title="ps info" class=hiddennode>

<p>ps displays information about a selection of the active processes. If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed information, use top(1) instead.</p>

<p>This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:</p>

<ul>
<li>UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.</li>
<li>BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.</li>
<li>GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear. There are some synonymous options, which are functionally identical, due to the many standards and ps implementations that this ps is compatible with.</p>

<p>Note that "ps -aux" is distinct from "ps aux". The POSIX and UNIX standards require that "ps -aux" print all processes owned by a user named "x", as well as printing all processes that would be selected by the -a option. If the user named "x" does not exist, this ps may interpret the command as "ps aux" instead and print a warning. This behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old scripts and habits. It is fragile, subject to change, and thus should not be relied upon.</p>

<p>By default, ps selects all processes with the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal as the invoker. It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in [dd-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD). Output is unsorted by default.</p>

<p>The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead of the executable name. You can override this with the PS_FORMAT environment variable. The use of BSD-style options will also change the process selection to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may be described as setting the selection to be the set of all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on a terminal. These effects are not considered when options are described as being "identical" below, so -M will be considered identical to Z and so on.</p>

<p>Except as described below, process selection options are additive. The default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes are added to the set of processes to be displayed. A process will thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection criteria.</p>

</div>

<div id=node2 data-title="Process state codes" class=hiddennode>

<p>Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a process.</p>

<ul>
<li>D    Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)</li>
<li>R    Running or runnable (on run queue)</li>
<li>S    Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)</li>
<li>T    Stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced.</li>
<li>W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)</li>
<li>X    dead (should never be seen)</li>
<li>Z    Defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent.</li>
</ul>

<p>For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:</p>

<ul>
<li>&lt; high-priority (not nice to other users)</li>
<li>N low-priority (nice to other users)</li>
<li>L has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)</li>
<li>s is a session leader</li>
<li>l is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)</li>
<li>&#43; is in the foreground process group</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id=node3 data-title="Command string" class=hiddennode>

<p>Modifications to the arguments may be shown. The output in this column may contain spaces. A process marked <defunct> is partly dead, waiting to be fully destroyed by its parent. Sometimes the process args will be unavailable; when this happens, ps will instead print the executable name in brackets. (alias cmd, command). See also the comm format keyword, the -f option, and the c option.</p>

<p>When specified last, this column will extend to the edge of the display. If ps can not determine display width, as when output is redirected (piped) into a file or another command, the output width is undefined. (it may be 80, unlimited, determined by the TERM variable, and so on) The COLUMNS environment variable or --cols option may be used to exactly determine the width in this case. The w or -w option may be also be used to adjust width.</p>

</div>

<div id=node4 data-title="Types of Threads" class=hiddennode>

<p>There are three kinds of threads:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kernel threads</li>
<li>Kernel-only threads</li>
<li>User threads.</li>
</ul>

<p>A kernel thread is a kernel entity, like processes and interrupt handlers; it is the entity handled by the system scheduler. A kernel thread runs in user mode environment when executing user functions or library calls; it switches to kernel mode environment when executing system calls. Kernel threads cannot be accessed from the user mode environment, except through the threads library.</p>

<p>A kernel-only thread is a kernel thread that executes only in kernel mode environment. Kernel-only threads are controlled by the kernel mode environment programmer through kernel services.</p>

<p>User mode programs can access user threads through a library. User threads are part of a portable programming model. User threads are mapped to kernel threads by the threads library, in an implementation dependent manner. The threads library uses a proprietary interface to handle kernel threads.</p>

<div id=node5 data-title="Softirqd daemon" class=hiddennode>

<p>ksoftirqd is a per-cpu kernel thread that runs when the machine is under heavy soft-interrupt load. Soft interrupts are normally serviced on return from a hard interrupt, but it’s possible for soft interrupts to be triggered more quickly than they can be serviced. If a soft interrupt is triggered for a second time while soft interrupts are being handled, the ksoftirq daemon is triggered to handle the soft interrupts in process context.</p>

<p>If ksoftirqd is taking more than a tiny percentage of CPU time, this indicates the machine is under heavy soft interrupt load.</p>

</div>

<div id=node6 data-title="Watchdog Daemon" class=hiddennode>

<p>In a physical server, a watchdog is a simple piece of hardware which is supposed to restart the server if it hangs without needing any administrator intervention. Watchdogs used to come as separate cards, but nowadays the feature is found in many chipsets, often integrated with other useful bits of server / remote access functionality like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band_management">remote serial port, wake-on-LAN, hardware event monitoring</a> etc.</p>

<p>So how does the watchdog work? "Is the machine hung?" is a tricky question to answer if you just look at the hardware level. In a "hung" machine, the CPU is most likely still running, and the kernel might still be up and responding to pings.</p>

<p>Hardware watchdogs instead rely on a piece of software running on the machine which must "tickle" a particular port, say every 10 seconds. If the watchdog doesn't get "tickled" after, say, 60 seconds (so 6 missed events), then it asserts the RESET line which results in a hard reboot.  (Of course, how often you must tickle the hardware varies from watchdog device to watchdog device, and is usually configurable. Some hardware watchdogs have more elaborate states - for example, they can deliver a "second chance" interrupt shortly before they deal the final death blow to the machine. In reality no one uses anything but the basic tickle/reset function.)</p>

<p>So the hardware defers to some software which has to keep tickling the hardware, or else face reboot. But how does this software work? In Linux we use the venerable watchdog daemon project. This is an unusual case where you actually want the software to do lots of "useless" work. So the daemon will typically ping a remote network address, do a process listing, maybe write something to disk and access the service, and run some custom scripts, and only if all those succeed will it tickle the watchdog port. Every 10 seconds.</p>

<p>If you think about some ways in which a server can "hang" you can see why this works. Example (1): Hard disk drive stops sending back interrupts. Processes begin to go into the uninterruptible "D" state, and don’t come out. Watchdog daemon itself enters the D state when it writes to the disk, hence the watchdog port is never tickled and the server gets rebooted. Example (2): Web server parent process segfaults.  Existing and some new requests are still being serviced, so the server appears to be working from the outside, but less reliably, at least for a little while. The watchdog daemon lists out the processes in the system and notices that the web server parent process is gone (because of a custom test). As a result, it doesn’t tickle the watchdog port, and so the machine is rebooted. Example (3): A large SQL request results in an important database table getting locked. The watchdog daemon periodically fetches a database-backed web page from the web server. The watchdog daemon's request hangs. The watchdog port isn't tickled. The web server reboots.</p>

<div id=node7 data-title="netns" class=hiddennode>

<p>Linux network namespaces (netns) is a lightweight container-based virtualization that is part of the mainline 2.6.27+ Linux kernel. A virtual network stack can be associated with a process group. This is similar to the FreeBSD jail mechanism.</p>

<p>Each namespace has its own loopback device and process space. Virtual or real devices can be added to each network namespace, and you can assign IP addresses to these devices and use them as a network node. By default these network namespaces share the same filesystem, just like CORE nodes in FreeBSD. Netns does not have the same security and resource restrictions as OpenVZ containers, and do not require a separate OS template.</p>
